## OOP

**UML => unified modeling Langage**: standarized notation for diagrams to visualize object-oriented design.

### Object-oriented Fundemental:

**Procdeural:** is a series of operations to excute, like c.
* it is good for simple program

**object oriented manner:** rather than describing a sequence of steps, several mini programs where each object contains its own data and logic to describe how it behaves and interacts with other objects.

Advanges oop:
* code re-usability

oop is not a language it reffere to programming paradigm.

##### Logic programming languages
* Prolog

#### Functional programming language
* Haskel

#### oop programming language 
* c#,c++,java,python,javaScript,Go,perl,php,R,Ruby,swift,VB,Net,and many others.

**object:** what's an object in a real world so mug is object and phone and cookie.

**Attributes , properties,characteristics , state,field,variables** : these are terms in programming.

**All objects have...**
* identity,Olivia's coffe mug.
* Attributes,color,size,fullness.
* Behaviers,fiil(),empty(),clean().

**every object is self-contained**
**software also decsribes thins has non-tangible like acount or time , date

### objects = nouns
* things
* people 
* places
* ideas
* concepts
  **if you could put the word (the) in front of it that is an object**
  * the mug
  * the person
  * the document
  * the account
  * the date
** Behaviesr = verbs** 
you won't be say ~~the texting~~ , or ~~the rainnig~~.

**Class:** is code-template for creating program object.
creates many objects based on one class.

**Class Components:**
* name or type: what's it => RoundedCookie
* Attributes or properties: what it describe => weight , color , icing.
* Behavier or operations: what it can do => decorate() , consume().

**Methos:** 
* A program procedure that can return a value
* Defined as part of a class
* Can only access data known to its object

class just a definition but object is  actual data
**creating object = instantiation**


**Existing classes on oo languages**:
* Strings
* Dates
* Collesctions
* File I/O
* NetWorking
  
**Frameworks and libraries:**
  * Java Class Library
  * c++ Standard Library
  * .Net framework BCL
  * Ruby Standard Library
  * Python Standard Library

**four fundamentals idea in oop :**
* Abstractiopn
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation

**Abstraction** means focus on essential qualities.

**Encapsulation** Hide attirbutes from anything out of the class -> black boxing

there are some reason to use Encapsulations
* can't reach to attribute in class
* limit number of something

**Encapsulate much as possible**

**Inheritance:**
* base a new object or class on a exsiting one.
* inherit the exsiting attributes and methods.
* Great form of code reuse.
  
super, parent , base = the top classes 
sub , child , derived = the bottom classes

c++,python > allow multiple inheritance
java, c# , swift , Ruby > allow single inheritance

**Polymorphism** having many forms

* **Dynamic Polymorphism (run-time):** Use the same interface for methods on different types of objects that may implament those in differnt way

*overriding:* the same name and parameter but differnt body.

**Static polymorphism (compile-time):** this uses many features like *oveloading* : implement multiple method with same name but different parameters

**Object oriented**:
* Analysis -> understand your problem  q > what do you need to do ?
* Design -> plan your solution q > how are you going to do it ?
* Programming -> build it  

**five step approach:**
1. Gather requirements.
2. Describe the application
3. identify the main object
4. describe the interactions
5. Create a class diagram
   
  **UML => unified modeling Langage**: standarized notation for diagrams to visualize object-oriented design.

  **Types of UML Diagrams:**
  * Structural Diagram
    * Class diagram
    * Component diagram
    * Deployment diagram
    * Object diagram
    * Package diagram
    * profile diagram
    * interaction diagram
    * Timing diagram
  
  UML tools:
  * Commerical or open source
  * Support platform
  * Diagram drawing capabilities
  * code generation capabilities

## Requirements
what does it need to do?

**Functional Requirement:** What must it do ?
**non-Functional Requirement:**
 How  should it to do ?
  * Legal
  * Performance
  * Support
  * Security
  
  **FURPS Requirement:**  

  * Functionality -> Capabilty,Reusabilit,Security core customer wants 
  * Usability -> Human Factors,Asethetics,Consistency,Documentation
  * Reliability -> Availability , Failure Rate & Duration,Predictability
  * Performance -> Speed , efficiency , Resource ,Scalability
  * Supportability -> Testability , Extensibility , Serviceability ,Configurability  
   **FURPS+ Requirement:**
   Design - must be built
     Implementation  -  Does it have to be written in a certain language? Are there standards or methodologies that need to be followed?
       InterFace - external system
       physical - hardware

   ## Use Cases

   **a use case needs three essential things:** 
   * a title: that describes a goal, 
   * Primary actor :the person who will interact with the application to achieve that goal, referred to as a primary actor, 
   * and the execution flow, or steps needed to accomplish the goal.

**Active Voice:** omit needless word
| User story                   | use case               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| short                        | long                   |
| one goal                     | multiple goal          |
| informal                     | casual                 |
| placeholder for conversation | record of conversation |
---
## Domain Modeling
**Conceptual Model:** Represents important objects and relationships between them.

**CRC or CRH:**
* Class or Component-> name of class.
* Rsponsinilty -> things that take care of.
* Collaboration or Helper -> other classes interact with.

## class Diagram

**Destructors = Finalikzer**: it's called when object destroyed.


**inheritance = is a ..**
**aggregation has a ..**
Design pattern : the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem.
