What is GitHub?
I'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source ðŸ“– projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?

At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.

From software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.

GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.

GitHub uses Git ðŸ“–, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor ðŸ“– to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.

GitHub helps people do much more.

GitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!




**command line** 
* the only place where you can run all Git commands in their full functionality. 
* if you know how to perform the Git command on the command line, you can probably figure it out on the GUI version if it's available.
*  team members can get used to doing things nuanced from each other. 
*  A GUI can also change


**Using the command line om mac**
* pwd -> print working directory
* cd -> change directory
* ls -> list ffiles
* touch -> create an empty file
* mkdir -> create an empty folder
  
**Using the command line om windows**
* pwd -> print working directory
* cd -> change directory
* dir -> list ffiles
* copy con -> create an empty file
* mkdir -> create an empty folder


**check is git is installed:**
* git --version
