# CSS

use to style the content

- default pixel for font size : 16xp

why did I tell you to use a Class and not an ID?

we never use IDs.
We always use Classes because by using Classes,
we are prepared for the future.So imagine that we used in fact, an ID of Related,
but then at some point later, somewhere on the page,
we wanted to add another list of related posts.
